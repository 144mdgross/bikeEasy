##Who has this problem?

##How does your project solve this problem?
	It gives users access to all three legs of their trip (bike to the bus station, bus between cities, and bike to destination) in once place. It also provides weather information so people can understand what conditions they will be biking in.
##What web APIs did it use?
	-Google Maps Javascript API
	-Google Maps Directions API
	-Google Places API
  -Google Maps Geocoding API
	-Open Weather API
##What technologies did it use?
	Languages: html, CSS, vanilla Javascript
	Frameworks: Materialize and jQuery.
##What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
	Encouragement about the total time/ distance feature and how that felt necessary to Joshua.  
##What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?
	Making google directions service render three different sets of directions on one map and list those directions all on one page was definitely the hardest. Google designed the service to only display one route at a time unless you’re using waypoints….however….waypoints are not allowed in any form if transit is the mode of travel. So...finding a way around that was extremely hard.
